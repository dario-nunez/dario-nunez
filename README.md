## Hi, I'm Dario 👋

... a free-range code herder and overeager 20 something year old *trying* to change the world for the better. I like to solve problems, and software engineering is my tool of choice!

My work philosophy is centered around: `💥 impact`, `🌱 adaptability` and `🤝 collaboration`, which (usually) helps me take projects from **paper** to **production 🚀**!
